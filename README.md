(Project ongoing)

## Things I learned:
- Using hooks is tricky, but cool. For complex state, I still prefer class components, but this may be inexperience talking.
- React is very, VERY cool. I feel like I barely touched upon surface and am already in love. A lot of it is due JSX, though.
- I used fecth api in a actual project! Using apis is cool, but there are a few things to figure out when using fetch+react. useRef hook, I am looking at you!
