# odin-memory-card

(Project ongoing)

## Things I learned:
- Using hooks is tricky, but cool. For complex state, I still prefer class components, but this may be inexperience talking.
- React is very, VERY cool. I feel like I barely touched upon surface and am already in love. A lot of it is due JSX, though.
- I used fecth api in a actual project! Using apis is cool, but there are a few things to figure out when using fetch+react. useRef hook, I am looking at you!

## Future Features amd Updates
- Change the header :v
- Add captions with quotes from [kanye.rest](https://kanye.rest/)
- Add gameOver modal
- Add feedback for when user scored a point and lost that match (and remove the current picked tell)
- Add options for more pictures (or less) pictures
- Add refresh button for new images and captions
